He showed how, given a handful of simple\\n\\noperators and a notation for functions, you can\\n\\nbuild a whole programming language.\\n\\nHe called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\"\\n\\nbecause one of his key ideas was to use a simple\\n\\ndata structure called a list for both\\n\\ncode and data.It\\'s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not\\n\\njust as a landmark in the history of computers, but as', metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\PaulGrahamEssaySmall\\\\rootsoflisp.txt'}),\n",
